Income Classification
ðŸ”¹ Data Preparation
âœ…Collect income data with features like age, education, and occupation.
âœ…Handle missing values, encode categorical features (Label Encoding), and scale numerical features.
âœ…Split into training & testing sets.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training
âœ… Logistic Regression â€“ Simple, interpretable, assumes linear separability, sensitive to outliers.
âœ… Random Forest â€“ Captures non-linear patterns, robust to outliers, computationally expensive.
âœ… XGBoost â€“ High accuracy, handles complex interactions, needs careful tuning to avoid overfitting.
